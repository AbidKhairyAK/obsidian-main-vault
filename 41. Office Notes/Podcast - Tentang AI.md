ðŸ“Œ PERTANYAAN PERTANYAAN MENYANGKUT AI:

1. Pernah nggak sih lo ngerasa belajar jadi lebih gampang gara-gara teknologi? Gimana AI bisa bantu kita belajar lebih efektif?
   - pernah
   - yg akan dibahas text-to-image AI & LLM/NLP chatgpt, gemini
   - efektif untuk hal basic dan sekedar mencari info
   - tidak disarankan untuk advance / specific
   - mending googling / bertanya ke forum
   - contoh: reddit, quora, grup facebook,  programmer: stackoverflow, github issue
   - tujuan: jawaban dan opini pada forum, ada reply/komentar nya, sedangkan di ai tidak
   - tujuan: pertanyaan dan jawaban di forum bisa dilihat oleh yg lain
     
2. Gimana sih cara AI bisa bantu kita lebih produktif setiap hari?
   - jangan terikat, sumber bervariasi
   - menyelesaikan masalah sampingan, dan kita tidak mencoba menjadi expert pada bidang tersebut
   - contoh buat formula excel
   - contoh buat subtitle dalam bahasa yang sama
   - expert butuh pengalaman dan latihan
     
3. Apa lo pernah coba bikin karya seni atau musik pakai bantuan AI? Gimana rasanya?
   - pernah
   - tapi hanya iseng, atau sebagai pelengkap karya yg ada
   - cerita tentang concept artist
     
4. melihat gimana gen z sekarang ini, menurut lo perlu ga sih gen z tuh memperhatikan etika nya dalam penggunaan ai?
    - perlu
    - jika dalam bentuk karya seni, beri citation/credit ke ai
    - tidak percaya sepenuhnya kepada hasil dari AI, tetep lakukan crosschek agar meminimalisir misinformasi
    - tidak bergantung sepenuhnya ke AI, tetap pelajari ilmu dan cari pengalaman sebanyaknya pada bidang yang ingin dikuasai

### Notes

#### how to stay mentally healthy in current AI evolution and surrounding FOMO as Frontend Dev

> Large companies move slowly when it comes to adopting new tech. In fact, you'll most likely be asked to maintain code that's on the verge of EOL. And you don't want to work for someone/company that expects you to be experienced in whatever the boss read about that morning

> What starts to separate frontend engineers is the understanding of how to bring a project from idea to fruition, and _most_ of that is not about coding; it's about communication and process

> It doesn't matter if we're AI assisted or not - we still need to know how to work with people around us and have a common understanding where we're heading.

> 99% of the people you see using AI for stuff don't know shit about machine learning or AI -- that's more the domain of the CS/math PhDs -- they wrote a wrapper around an existing model or wrote an API integration with someone else's AI, two very common programming tasks that don't require much deep knowledge. So don't sweat it.

#### Productivity

> I work as an account executive where a lot of my time is spent troubleshooting issues for clients. I use Notion to log these items and I use Notion AI to summarize hundreds of words of updates for my weekly calls with the client

> The issue I have with AI is its unreliability. A subtlety people tend to forget with AI is that it can _attempt_ to generate something that feels coherent and correct, but there's no guarantee it will. It can easily spew out code that doesn't work, text that doesn't make sense, and info that are plain wrong with the confidence of a politician on a talk show. The time you gained by letting it generate something you'll have to waste by double-checking anyway.
> 
> So, while I agree AI has its uses (like image recognition and such), in my case it would just be the equivalent of a shitty autocomplete. And no autocomplete is better than a shitty autocomplete. If I'm gonna have to check what the damn thing did anyway, I may aswell do it myself. Atleast then I'll fully understand what I made and will be sure what I made works.
> 
> Productivity isn't just about speed, it's also about reliability. It doesn't matter how fast your car goes if there's a 50% chance it'll break down before you arrive where you want to go.

> ChatGPT for maintenance tasks. Took over a project that had a bad array of hundreds of entries, needed to be json, so I just copied and pasted and had it convert for me. Or sometimes Iâ€™ll post a block and tell it make sure all the brackets and tags have openings and closings

> As someone who grew up on the internet- you have a higher chance of finding the right answer on google in the immediate replies after someone posts the wrong answer.

> I was working on a personal google sheet the other day and didnâ€™t know how to do some automation. Asked Gemini and it spit out the answer. Just had to tweak it a little.

> There was some twitter post recently about someone in an art design and concept team that hired a bunch of people who used image generation tools and nothing else- it didn't end pretty for the "AI" folks.
> 
> They were told to iterate on some of the concepts they'd presented as their own work and the issue became that they couldn't get the models to _iterate_ on something- only generate something entirely new- so the artists on the team were sat there doing their regular work while a few of the image generator people slaved on prompts over and over- producing work that the management would claim is "good, but just remove x or y, and change z" and become bewildered when the prompt people would come back with entirely different images. They were let go once the company realized they couldn't actually use their machines to do the work without hiring entirely different people (actual concept artists) to edit them- when at that point you should just hire an artist to do the concept work from the start.

> I think this is a pattern we're going to see in all applications of AI - it's really great for conjuring up an immediate response which is good enough.
> 
> It's the same with all the help desk chat bots. If all you need is an answer which you just don't have the skills or knowledge to Google effectively then it's great. But if you have a problem of any greater complexity than that? The AI help desk is just going to go around in circles

> This is the problem I'm talking about though: there's nothing wrong with how it works! It's fucking amazing! Nothing that I'm saying is dismissing that. The problem is that _most people using it don't understand how it works_ and like the guy up top there are just using it as "easier Google".
> 
> And many of the responses to the exact process I'm raising are just like yours - missing the point because the people like you that **do** know how good the technology is don't seem to be able to see past that and acknowledge that the people who **don't** know how good the technology is are toddling blindly into something with incredibly disruptive and chaotic consequences.
> 
> This is scary shit. The tech is so clever that people just blindly trust everything it says. It's not just that they don't realize all the cool shit it can do; they're actively bobbing around in, and perpetuating a sea of misinformation.
